Webservers sends all the certificates including root CA.

Client looks are following:

 1. If certifcate is valid => time check
 2. Verify signatures => Lets say Root CA (RCA) has to verify Leaf Cert (LC1). RCA will decrypt signature on LC1 with its public key. It will get the hash 
                         of LC1 cert. Now RCA will calculate hash of LC1 and match if has matches. If we trust ROOT CA, we trust entire chain.
